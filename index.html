            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                I am a recent psychology graduate from Cal Poly Pomona with 3 years of cognitive neuroscience research experience. Since graduating this May, I have been formalizing my programming skillset by working on personal programming projects and practicing with new datasets. I plan to translate my education in psychology, programming, and social justice to a career in cognitive neuroscience. I am passionate about social justice, fitness, running, true crime, UX, and photography. Most recently, I have been learning how to play the guitar and volleyball.
